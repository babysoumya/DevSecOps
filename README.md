# Build a DevSecOps Pipeline in GitHub
- This repository shows how to build an enterprise-ready DevSecOps Pipeline with GitHub. 
- Developed an enterprise-ready DevSecOps pipeline using GitHub Actions to integrate security into the software development lifecycle.
- Built a Spring Boot microservice with REST APIs, ensuring security compliance through secret detection, cryptographic key management, and secure hashing.
- Implemented secure key generation using KeyGenerator and SecureRandom, avoiding insecure random number generation and hardcoded secrets.
-Integrated static application security testing (SAST) tools to detect vulnerabilities, including hardcoded credentials, weak hashing algorithms (MD5), and insecure random number generation.
- Enhanced API security by validating user input, preventing direct echoing of user-supplied data, and implementing best practices for cryptographic security.
- Automated deployment and security scanning using GitHub Actions, ensuring compliance with DevSecOps best practices.
